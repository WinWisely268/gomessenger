<h1>Go Chat</h1>

I plan to play with Go by building a small chat service. 
The backend server will be written in Go, while the ui
is a full web project (yarn, parcel, React or Vue...).

Why something like this? Because my research has shown
that Go is best used for <b>web application and microservices</b>.

Small Task(s):
 - [ ] Auto-generate models in Go and JS.
 - [x] Test if Go can publish a web UI.
 - [ ] Build a non-compromised chat UI.
 - [x] Test websocket communication.
 - [ ] Implement all key features.
 - [ ] Deploy to a docker image.
 - [ ] Deploy to Google Cloud.

I just want to learn more about Go and Web App. That's it!
